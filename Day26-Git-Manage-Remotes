# 🔀 Day 26 – Git Remotes Update + Commit + Push (Production Repo Sync)

## 📌 Scenario

The xFusionCorp development team updated a project hosted at:

/opt/demo.git


This repository is cloned on the Storage Server at:

/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/demo


DevOps added a **new Git remote**, and the task was to:

- Add that remote locally
- Copy a file into the repo
- Commit changes to master
- Push master to the new remote

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Add new remote `dev_demo`
- Point it to `/opt/xfusioncorp_demo.git`
- Copy `/tmp/index.html` into repo
- Commit to master
- Push master branch to new remote

---

## 🛠️ Tasks Performed

### ✅ 1. Navigate to Repository

```bash
cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/demo
✅ 2. Add New Remote
git remote add dev_demo /opt/xfusioncorp_demo.git
Verify:

git remote -v
✅ 3. Copy File into Repo
cp /tmp/index.html .
✅ 4. Stage & Commit Changes
git add index.html
git commit -m "Added index.html file"
✅ 5. Push Master to New Remote
git push dev_demo master
✅ Verification
git log --oneline
git remote -v
✔ Commit visible
✔ Remote added
✔ Master pushed successfully

🧠 Key Learnings
Git allows multiple remotes per repository.

Always verify remotes using git remote -v.

File changes must be staged before commit.

Pushing explicitly requires:

git push <remote> <branch>
Production Git tasks require precision — small mistakes can overwrite code.

🎤 Interview Questions
Q1. What is a Git remote?
A remote is a reference to another Git repository location.

Q2. Why use multiple remotes?
To sync code across different servers or environments.

Q3. Difference between origin and custom remotes?
origin is default; custom remotes allow pushing to additional repos.

Q4. What happens if you push without committing?
Nothing — Git only pushes committed changes.

Q5. How do you verify a successful push?
Using:

git log
git remote -v
