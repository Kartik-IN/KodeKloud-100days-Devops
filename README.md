Welcome to my **100 Days of DevOps Challenge** repository.  
This repository documents my daily hands-on DevOps learning using real labs, practical scenarios, and structured documentation.

My goal is to become a strong **DevOps Engineer** by mastering:

- Linux & System Administration
- Docker & Containerization
- Kubernetes
- Cloud (AWS)
- CI/CD Pipelines
- Infrastructure as Code
- Monitoring & Security

Everything here is written in simple language with explanations, mistakes, fixes, and interview notes.

## 🧠 Learning Method

I follow a simple learning cycle:

1. Understand the problem clearly
2. Think logically before running commands
3. Make mistakes and debug calmly
4. Validate results properly
5. Document learning in detail
6. Reflect and improve continuously

This approach helps build real engineering thinking instead of memorization.

Each day includes:

- Common interview questions
- Real-world explanations

This helps strengthen interview confidence along with hands-on skills.
