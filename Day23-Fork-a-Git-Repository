# 🍴 Day 23 – Fork a Git Repository (Gitea UI)

## 📌 Scenario
The Nautilus project teams use an internal **Git server (Gitea)** for source control.  
A new developer named **Jon** joined the team and needed to start working on an existing project.

To enable this, Jon was required to **fork an existing Git repository** using the **Gitea Web UI**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Access the internal Gitea UI
- Authenticate using provided credentials
- Locate the required repository
- Fork the repository under the correct user account
- Verify successful fork creation

---

## 🛠️ Task Details
- **Git UI:** Gitea
- **Username:** `jon`
- **Password:** `jon_pass123`
- **Repository to Fork:** `sarah/story-blog`
- **Fork Owner:** `jon`

> ⚠️ Note: This task required **Web UI interaction**, not CLI-based Git commands.

---

## 🧩 Solution Steps

### ✅ 1. Access Gitea UI
- Clicked the **Gitea UI** button from the top navigation bar
- Redirected to the internal Git server login page

---

### ✅ 2. Login to Gitea
- Username: `jon`
- Password: `jon_pass123`

✔️ Successfully authenticated

---

### ✅ 3. Locate Repository
- Searched for repository:  
sarah/story-blog

- Opened the repository owned by user **sarah**

---

### ✅ 4. Fork the Repository
- Clicked the **Fork** button
- Selected **jon** as the destination owner

✔️ Repository forked successfully under `jon/story-blog`

---

### ✅ 5. Verification
- Confirmed fork existence under Jon’s account
- Verified repository structure and files

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Forking allows independent development without affecting the original repository
- Web UI Git operations are common in enterprise environments
- Correct user context matters even in UI-based workflows
- Forks are essential for collaboration and controlled code contributions

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Forking under the wrong user
- Modifying the original repository instead of forking
- Skipping verification after fork
- Assuming CLI access is always available

## 🎤 Interview Questions

### Q1. What is the purpose of forking a repository?
Forking allows developers to work independently while preserving the original codebase.

---

### Q2. How is forking different from cloning?
Forking creates a new repository under a user account, while cloning only creates a local copy.

---

### Q3. Why do organizations prefer forks?
They enable controlled collaboration, code reviews, and safe experimentation.

---

### Q4. Can forks be synchronized with upstream repositories?
Yes, forks can pull updates from the original repository when needed.
